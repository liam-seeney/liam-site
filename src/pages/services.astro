        <h3>Timber Frame Construction</h3>
        <p>
          Timber-frame construction is at the heart of everything we build. This
          modern method uses precision-engineered timber panels to create a
          structure that’s strong, warm, and highly energy-efficient. Because
          the frame is manufactured from sustainably sourced wood, it has a
          lighter environmental footprint than traditional masonry, while still
          offering excellent durability and design flexibility. It also allows
          us to complete projects faster and with less disruption, whether we’re
          adding a kitchen extension, creating a self-contained annexe, or
          crafting a bespoke garden room. The result is a beautifully finished
          space with outstanding thermal performance — comfortable all year
          round and built to stand the test of time.

        <h3>Annexes</h3>
        <p>
          Self-contained annexes are perfect for modern living — ideal as guest
          accommodation, independent living spaces, or even short-stay holiday
          lets. Each annexe is constructed using sustainable timber-frame
          techniques, offering exceptional energy efficiency and long-term
          durability. We focus on intelligent design, beautiful finishes, and
          practical layouts that feel like a natural extension of your property,
          providing comfort, privacy, and value that lasts.

        <h3>Extensions</h3>
        <p>
          Timber-frame extensions are a contemporary way to add space and
          transform the way you live. Whether you’re expanding your kitchen,
          creating an open-plan living area, or adding a new room with character
          and warmth, we combine precision craftsmanship with high-performance
          materials to deliver stunning results. Every extension is built to the
          same standard as a new home — highly insulated, sustainably built, and
          seamlessly integrated with your existing property.
