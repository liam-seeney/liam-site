        <h3>Timber Frame Construction</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of everything we build is precision timber-frame
          construction. This modern method delivers strength, warmth, and
          exceptional energy efficiency, all while using sustainably sourced
          materials. Timber offers greater design flexibility than traditional
          masonry and allows us to build faster with less disruption. Whether
          you’re planning an extension, annexe, or bespoke garden room, our
          timber-frame approach ensures your new space is beautifully crafted,
          thermally efficient, and built to last.

        <h3>Garden Rooms</h3>
        <p>
          Our bespoke garden rooms create beautiful, functional spaces that
          enrich everyday living. From peaceful home offices and creative
          studios to home gyms and entertaining spaces, every garden room is
          built to the same specification as a modern home. Using
          high-performance timber-frame construction, we ensure your space is
          warm, durable, and comfortable all year round — a true extension of
          your lifestyle.

        <h3>Annexes</h3>
        <p>
          Our self-contained annexes are designed for modern living — ideal for
          guests, independent family members, or holiday accommodation. Each is
          built using sustainable timber-frame methods to deliver excellent
          insulation, durability, and efficiency. We design every annexe to
          complement your property and provide a comfortable, private space that
          feels like home.

        <h3>Extensions</h3>
        <p>
          A timber-frame extension is a contemporary, energy-efficient way to
          add space and value to your home. Whether you’re creating an open-plan
          kitchen, a family room, or additional living space, we combine expert
          craftsmanship with modern building materials to achieve stunning,
          seamless results. Every project is tailored to your home and built to
          the same high standard as a new build.
