          We create inviting spaces that make life at home richer and more flexible. As timber-frame specialists, we design and build everything from garden offices, gyms and workshops to annexes, holiday cottages, garages, and elegant kitchen or living extensions. Timber-frame construction lets us deliver rooms that feel warm, comfortable and solid, with excellent thermal performance and a light environmental footprint thanks to sustainably sourced materials. Every project is finished to the same high standard, whether it’s a cosy garden retreat or a striking new extension — giving you a space that blends seamlessly with your home and enhances the way you live.
