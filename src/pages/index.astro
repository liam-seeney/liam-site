      <h3>Hi! &#128075;</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Liam, I design and build high-quality timber frame structures across
        the West Midlands. From stylish garden rooms to practical home
        extensions, every project is crafted with care and precision.
      </p>
      <p>
        My timber frame approach means faster build times, excellent energy
        efficiency, and a clean, modern finish. Whether you want a dedicated
        home office, extra living space, or a place to unwind, I'll create a
        structure that suits your home and lifestyle.
      </p>
